                              <h3>Topic</h3>
                        <p>We want to create a simple-to-operate program for users that can increase security on their systems to defend a system from intrusion, stop personal data being leaked through websites, emails, mobile data storage and much more! STEVE, being a simple-to-operate program, is also a tool for learning, STEVE will be equipped with a library of known scams and tactics, as well as the ability to recognise them. STEVE is able to alert the user to what the detected intrusion attempt is doing, and provide instructions on how to stop it or have an option to enable STEVE to defend against such intrusions automatically, whilst providing feedback and the process taken.</p>
<p>We want STEVE to educate users against the tactics that hostile parties would use against them. STEVE would protect the user, but ultimately; any security system is only as strong as its weakest link. Sometimes, the problem exists between the keyboard and the chair. But with STEVE, hopefully society will become more wary of scammers and phishers.</p>
                              
                              								<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>A world free of corruption, of deceit, and of fear is a beautiful vision. Stop Technologically Educated Villains Embezzling (STEVE) could help achieve that. Some might say it’s a bit ambitious, but it’s within reach. Security may not be that ‘sexy’, when it comes to IT trends; but it’s a necessity. Protecting the user from scams, virus and phishing is important work; and if we’re able to do it, it’ll show future employers that we can stick with an essential, long-term project. It’ll also show off our skills as a team, and individuals.</p>
                              
                              <h3>Landscape</h3>
                              <p>Many competitors exist for *one* facet of STEVE. The anti-virus aspect of it is something that’s been done many times, and done pretty well. Sure, systems are still infected; but every system is only as strong as its weakest point. That’s where our difference comes into play. STEVE is a tool for *educating* the user; so they’re less likely to click on suspicious links or download untrustworthy attachments. It might teach them to improve their passwords, and be more conscious about to whom they’re giving their information. It might even teach them better security practices, locking their computer/device if they have to leave it unattended for a short while.</p>

									<h2>It Technologies</h2>
								</header>
              <h3>Rafi - Clouds, Services, Servers</h3>
<p><i>What does it do?</i>The cloud is not a new concept when it comes to computing it is actually just a metaphor for the internet. It is a virtual space that connects users from all over the globe, the internet is called a cloud as it's a way of sharing information via satellite networks. Cloud computing refers to sharing particular information over a network (the internet) it ranges from resources, software and information. This data is stored on physical servers which are maintained and controlled by computing providers, these are large companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google etc.</p>
 
<p>This technology has exploded in the last 8 or so years. Storing data and information on physical media such as DVD's or USB's was the most popular way to back up your data a few years ago, however as big companies can facilitate for low cost subscription network storage it has now become a lot easier for users to back up their data to the cloud rather than only physical media. This is mostly evident in Laptops, 8 years ago most laptops you would be able to buy would have a DVD drive slot as a lot of users had films and general data stored on discs. Now there are no current machines on the market that have an internal DVD drive. Why is that? Because discs are simply just not used anymore and take up too much space when it comes to the internals of a machine. Some manufacturers have taken this even further by removing all peripherals such as a USB slot, like Apples new MacBook's just having only USB-C slots, optimising the direction they want the future to go. Apple offers a iCloud storage solution which is subscription based and allows you to store any information on their network for a low monthly cost. This storage solution helps users who have a lot of devices and a lot of data spread across them, services like iCloud allow users to access their data whether it be on their phone, computer or even their TV. It allows for a secure method of backup as there is such a low possibility of hardware failure as it is not managed by the user but rather by the corporation as well as allowing for data to be accessed anywhere, anytime and on any device.</p>
 
<p>A big emerging use of cloud technology is streaming services, streaming services such as Netflix allow users to watch an abundance of content which takes up no storage on your device and can be accessed anywhere. It is pretty remarkable to see so many advancements in technology and what abilities cloud computing can have. The future looks brightest however with the development of video games. Video games are an extremely popular activity with today's generation and always seems to be growing, where all types of people around the world are playing it. The problem is that is quite an expensive hobby, you invest a lot of money into the hardware and then have to invest money into the video games which get outdated pretty quickly, whilst with consoles paying monthly subscription rates to be able to play online and with your friends. Google has recently announced an advancement in video games which could revolutionise the entire industry should it be done right. Google's announcement of Google Stadia promises to be a completely universal gaming streaming solution. Players will have the ability to play whatever they like, wherever they like on whatever device they like. 
</p>
<p><i>What is the likely impact?</i> 
Streaming services and subscriptions seem to go pretty hand in hand. It has been a great solution to the illegal distribution of media and content, where users consistently pay a monthly fee to gain access to specific content whenever and wherever they want. It would only make sense that this type of service would enter the video game sphere as well giving consumers an abundance of options to play video games. PC gaming can get very expensive as in order to achieve very high spec gaming you would need to have extremely up to date and fast hardware. Google Stadia answers this by putting the hardware on their end in their huge data centre and deliver it back to the user via streaming, so by streaming the content on any device you just need to have stable internet connection and a basic spec machine. It would allow for so many more gamers to come about as everyone would be able to play as long as they have internet and a device, it would also create jobs by helping out independent game developers get onto the platform as every game would be included under the subscription service the user can play whatever they like. Right now with video games the big companies such as EA rule the roost and it seems that the smaller companies cannot compete at all yet with a new service like this anyone can dream to make the next big thing and Google can help them facilitate that.</p>
<p><i>How will this affect me?</i> Video games are quite big in my day to day life, I find video games my number one choice when it comes to recreational entertainment. By having the ability to play on any device at any time would change the way I play video games. Streaming services as a whole seem to be the future of media and entertainment and therefore cloud computing and networking is in high demand for business and employers and is it is paving the way for distribution of content. This would also affect my friends whom I also play video games with as we can play together very easily as It would not matter what platform we choose to play the video game on allowing for any of us to play with whoever we meet at any time. I am a big supporter of the cloud and streaming services and think it can provide great things for technology in the future. As we learn more we can develop more and the only thing that can hold us back is what we limit ourselves to. For me then by this technology growing and expanding it would only be beneficial as it would create more jobs and new ideas.</p>
<h3>Caner Peler-  Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><i>What does it do?</i> Blockchain is a technology, where digital information (blocks) are stored within a public database(Chain). The blocks within this technology store information about transactions, and this could be the date, time and possible dollar amount of a purchase you may make from a possible store. The block storing the information including the ones who are participating within the transactions, being the buyer and seller. The block would record your name with the alongside of the seller. For example if you purchased merch from rmit online. The block would store your (Your unique name, Rmit University). Instead of the traditional method of recording your actual name, the blockchain technology records it without any identity information from the buyer. However each block created is unique in a sense how everyone has their own names. This is completed via the blockchain by the 'unique code hash', which allows blocks to distinguish themselves from the others. If multiple orders a made, the blocks will look similar but however they will be separated by their hash. However in order for a blockchain to occur the following must be present. Most importantly a transaction must occur to create the block, the newly made digital information. Once the transaction is made in then goes through the verification process. This verification is made via several networks of computers. This could be thousands of networks spread across over the globe. For example bitcoin has 'about 5 million computer networks' said by investopedia. These networks of numerous computers securely check whether the transactions have occurred. Once the check is done, the networks of computers verify the transaction. As it is verified it then gets uploaded to the block, with is unique hash of course. Ultimately blockchain is a technology that provides an alternative to the traditional way of recording online transactions in a more decentralised, discreet and identity hidden manner. The existence of this technology blockchain, allows us to further create more technologically advanced things, such as cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency in which it is supported and run by blockchain, allowing it to verify the transfers of occured funds independently from central banks making it decentralised. Ultimately this allows us to make secure transactions without any identity being recorded. This has most commonly brought to everyone's attention of one of the few forms of currency known as bitcoin. Due to the recent spike of cryptocurrency and blockchain. The popularity of cryptocurrency is not seen to be able to reach its peak again in short term of 3 years. However it likely to make another huge impact in the following 15 years. However for blockchain, it is being now widely spread and used by many more businesses and corporations.</p>
<p><i>What is the likely impact?</i> The potential impact of blockchain and cryptocurrency is deemed to be cryptocurrency to overtake and be the new form of currency we use as it will effectively replace our cash. However this is a extremely large goal to be achieved. At the very moment  cryptocurrency is being brought to a few retailers to help is growth in involvement into our daily lives. However i see crypto currency to most likely to be in charge of a portion of the current currency we have within the next 15 years. As i think it will take a lot longer to be in full charge. However for blockchain. It could be seen to be further involved and used in many more cases due to its intentions being favoured by the everyday consumers. If cryptocurrency succeeds it will obviously affect consumers and banks. This decentralisation will destroy banks as cryptocurrency is not supported by banks. Eventually closing banks and consumers also needing to be familiar with the digital currency as a new form of capital.</p>
<p><i>How will this affect you?</i>This wouldn't really affect me as much as i've been familiar and interacted with cryptocurrency for the past 3-4 years. However this will affect my daily interactions of purchasing in-store products. I'm not use to exchanging cryptocurrency for a product. For my family and most people out there, thay have little knowledge about cryptocurrency. Most people will find it difficult to moving from a solid, physical currency to a digital currency. And to how cryptocurrency can be gained by miners and the limit of how much of the currency can be overwhelming, especially the single value of bitcoin at the moment is, 1 = $7,737.34 AUD. 
So to introduce something technically advanced and new, will take a long time for people to get use to as our current currency is very different to crypto, therefore it is bound to create confusion and rejection by the society as they would be uncomfortable with this change. But for those who love technology would most likely happily go through crypto being out main type of currency.</p>
<h3>Simon (Machine Learning)</h3>
<p><i>What does it do?</i> Machine learning is an extension of Artificial Intelligence that provide systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience with minimal human intervention. This process of learning and experience starts with observing and reviewing data, such examples include: explicit instructions and pattern recognition to the point where the system can accurately and independently adapt from previous performed tasks to produce reliable, decisive results. Recent years Machine learning has risen and is only continuing to grow in an technologically advanced society, reasons being is the volume of available data and the ability to analyze substantial, complex data at a faster rate than humans, and as a result create cheaper and dependable data storages. Machine learning is split between two methods "supervised learning" and "unsupervised learning". Supervised learning consists of algorithms that are given the correct inputs and outputs and learns by comparing the answers to the actual inputs and outputs and modifies it accordingly. While, unsupervised learning is given no "correct answer" and the algorithm must identify and recognize certain patterns and create its own conclusion. What makes these successes possible are mainly two factors, one being the influx of information and knowledge (i.e. images, speech, video and text) available for researchers looking to study and train machine learning systems and the powerful hardware available, primarily graphic processing units (GPUs), that grants the ability to create sustainable and robust machine learning technology. Most industries working with tremendous amount of data have realized the value of machine learning systems. This includes industries such as financial services, Government, health care, retail, oil and gas and transportation. As an example of what machine learning can do now and how it's implemented in today's industries- Banks and other businesses use machine learning to identify and analyze data to prevent fraud. In addition, investment opportunities arise to assist investors on optimal trades. Furthermore, in health care industries machine learning is used to detect and assess a patient's health in order to identify future health problems, provide appropriate treatment and take quick action to avoid fatal illnesses and diseases. No doubt in the distant future machine learning will be integrated in many of today's industries, if it continues with its rapid success the future can expect deeper personalization (precise ads), cognitive services and many more- hardware developers will be forced to redesign machines to accompany the growth of machine learning.</p>
<p><i>What is the likely impact?</i> The advancement and development of machine learning both have its benefits and risks these include but are not limited to: climate change modelling, autonomous vehicles, medical research and risk assessments. The ability to accurately predict climate change based on the observation of data would allow for better and efficient climate change modelling. Not to mention the application of self-driving cars with time only being a setback, "intelligent cars" will be granted the ability to avoid obstacles and self-drive without the driver controlling it, we are seeing this today but in terms of safety it isn't reliable enough. Furthermore, machine learning as stated previously can provide uncharted knowledge on medicine allowing for the innovation of new treatments and proper diagnosis that may be overlooked by doctors. Of course like anything in this world, balance is needed with benefits comes with risks- with further advancement of machine learning, it creates a risk that machines may well surpass human intelligence to the point where they become "psychologically manipulative" and danger society. In addition, many argue very well that data is biased in the form of people creating the models and the data quality itself, thus skewing the results in an unfavourable manner and as a result raise questions on machine learning reliability. Nevertheless, growth in machine learning will only aid the jobs we have now and it will force us to lose tasks but not jobs, perhaps machines will be forced to do tedious tasks while humans concentrate on more important and specific tasks and it is up to society to adapt to the new changes, perhaps new jobs will arise from this. </p>
<p><i>How will this affect me?</i> Gaming has always been part of my life growing up and in the present, it's what I enjoy in my free time and a form of entertainment. With the prestigious upgrades of machine learning it won't be long before the introduction of "intelligent gaming" comes in to play, this could very much affect me as I enjoy being competitive and superior around my peers. Machine learning will be able to enhance my gameplay and "take it to another level" to say the least with it's precise analyzing and observant nature many people including myself will be able to practice with machines rather than humans. Not sure how it would affect my friends but perhaps we will have to adapt to a new norm, what tasks humans used to do will now be done with machines and with the development of machine learning improved health care will come along, which would greatly affect my family members considering they're coming to an age where it is more prevalent to get sick and contract illnesses and diseases.

<h3>Thomas - Cybersecurity</h3>
<p><i>What does it do?</i> Cyber security is the art of protecting networks and systems from attacks. Cybersecurity is a growing field, mainly because crime a constantly evolving field of its own. Currently, most of our passwords are protected by SSH 256 bit encryption. It's good enough for a lot of people and companies, but as computer's processing speed increases, so too does the ease in which it decrypts said passwords. As computers develop which can crack codes more easily, the more security technologies need to advance. In terms of the technologies involved, there are many ways of protecting servers from hostile intrusion. Anti-malware and antivirus software; heavy duty firewalls... encryption and DNS filtering to protect users from receiving false data help... but the *true* magic happens when users are aware of the vulnerabilities of a system. </p>
<p>Among the greatest threats to a network is a canny social engineer turning the users against it. Hackers know that a system is only as strong as its weakest link; and with encryption being tough to crack for most people with out specialised software and tools, social engineering is something that's available for everybody! It doesn't matter how secure a system is if the people responsible for it give away sensitive information. 
However, when users comply with basic security concepts like choosing good passwords, and maintaining a good awareness of social engineering attempts; their security is all but assured. If the employees of a company protect the servers from *physical* access, and keep themselves security conscious, it's *very* difficult for a hacker to attack a network. Most IT departments encourage their workers to choose secure passwords, to not divulge them or personal information like credit card numbers, and to not trust suspicious email sources. 
 </p>
<p>
The advances of cybersecurity in the next three years depend on what's necessary. As mentioned above, as computers advance in their ability to process data and decrypt passwords faster and easier; the more unassailable our networks have to be. But the Internet of Things (IoT) increases *everyone's* connectivity. With so many appliances all connected to each other, virtually all of our personal data will be stored in one place; likely the Cloud. The interconnected nature of the IoT means that everything is a vulnerability. Thus, a high priority for cybersecurity is to increase security for the Cloud, where all the data is stored; or on individual 'things' in the IoT.
Of course for the most part, the technical developments that make all the advancement possible are simply improved versions of what we have now. Better processors, larger memory; better cooling for said processors so they can run for longer... But socially, people are more and more willing to give up their security to websites and companies. However, there was a recent surge of distrust in social media and what companies do with their users data earlier in 2018. Facebook's data breach affected around 87 million users. People being suspicious and wary of what can happen with their data increases demand for better security.
 </p>
<p><i>What is the likely impact?</i> With better security, networks and databases, particularly those holding important information will be breached less often. That means that law enforcement agencies can prevent leaks of personal information of agents in attacks such as the one in America on the 15th of April, 2019. The people most affected by the development of better security will likely be corporations. Big companies, or anything that makes enough money is a tempting target for hackers. Of course, with companies getting better security, the people connected to it are safer by extension, especially if the company holds their personal data in a central database. Cybersecurity's unlikely to *create*  jobs, beyond the people skilled in implementing or subverting the security system. In terms of replacement, computers do the security and encryption better than people anyway. It'd make our current technologies and experts therein redundant, but it's unlikely to be the impetus for broad, sweeping change. Of course, if society becomes more paranoid about their data and security, they could implement more Peer-to-Peer networks, relying on each other rather than a central server.</p>
<p><i>How will this affect me?</i> Honestly, very little. I already try to keep my data protected, avoiding posting personal information on social media and various other websites. I'm not a hacker, so increased Cybersecurity won't make my life *harder*. Perhaps, at the very most; advanced security technology might convince me to purchase better software... The average citizen won't see much difference in their daily life, and neither will my family and friends. Perhaps workplaces will implement harsher security measures, maybe it'll be a little less convenient to store passwords and personal data on websites so autofill can complete forms for you... but beyond that, I don't see much difference arising from something which protects users from cyber-crime. </p>

									<h2>Project Ideas</h2>

							<p>The security of systems and users have always been a concern of the manufacturing company. With the implementation of firewall by countless organisations and many programs designed to defend the system from malware and system optimisation for increased performance, security has become easier to manage. The means by obtaining such programs can either be for free or obtained by purchasing a subscription for a certain amount of time. However, utilising software that isn't already preinstalled on the computer and/or purchasing a subscription can be avoided if the user were to have the knowledge about the internet and how to utilise it without getting viruses or any of the nasty malicious software on the computer in the first place. </p>
<p>S.T.E.V.E (or STEVE), is a simple-to-operate program for users that can increase security on their systems to defend a system from intrusion, stop personal data being leaked through websites, emails, mobile data storage and so much more. STEVE, being a simple-to-operate program, is also a program for learning, STEVE will be equipped with a library of known scams and tactics, as well as the ability to recognise them. STEVE is able to alert the user to what the detected intrusion attempt is doing, and provide instructions on how to stop it or have an option to enable STEVE to defend against such intrusions automatically, whilst providing feedback and the process taken. It will also have the ability to scan any page, forum or application that requires the user give their personal data to. If STEVE detects certain issues with the page in question, such as bad grammar or references to international banks such as Western Union; it will warn the user. </p>
<p>From an industry standpoint, not all industries want to hire people to stay on-guard just to protect their information, especially when the database isn't very big and easier to manage, for bigger organisations, that may change. STEVE will be able to utilise machine learning to assist the growing or the big industries in their security. Provided that STEVE is not capable to provide all the aid that is required, STEVE will act as a barrier for the malicious attack from external ane/or internal sources. If STEVE is unable to act against the malicious attack, professionals would be required to resolve the attack. With so many websites taking data from their users, and corporations and governments spying on the people for their own sinister purposes, having an extra layer of protection is beneficial for corporate and personal use, to train and to protect.</p>
<p>Detecting the threats such as phishing, malicious software can prove itself to be difficult to most, if not, some users. Having STEVE will make detecting phishing and other known dangers seem trivial through its library of common tactics and schemes that scammers, companies and governments use to obtain personal information and what they do with it. Educating users whether or not they should trust something with their data is the goal for the creation of STEVE as a lot of people are unable to recognise such threats and fall into their trap and have their way with your personal information, whether that is to distribute it or to mess the user's system up. STEVE can only do what the user tells STEVE to do and is also limited to its capabilities. At the end of the day, it's up to the users to decide as to what to do when receiving warning messages, whether to trust and allow the software to pass through or not. This is not to say that STEVE will be an unbreakable shield for data as there will be ways to bypass everything, STEVE is there to educate and lend a helping hand when malicious software attacks.</p>
<p>STEVE is for industrial and personal usage, to educate and ultimately allow the users to become more conscious with their personal information and how they protect it if they do, both online and offline. Utilising STEVE to secure information for big and small will assist the general public enjoy a life with a lessened risk of having their data stolen.</p>

									<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
                                  </header>
								
				<p> Caner Peler <br/> As a group the communication was well done, as we kept our communication consistent out side of class with a group chat we made. There was high levels of idea sharing and individual tasks taken, which was completed early due to our commitment to our group work. All members completed their relevant specified roles.  A possible improvement we as a group could have done is having a plan, to make the selecting process easier instead of picking our roles as we went. As I group I’ve learned a lot about each individuals desires and passion about technology. Also as a group I think we get along pretty well. For contribution, id say it was fairy distributed and fairly done.

<p><u>What went well</u>: I think we all pulled together and did a good job actually completing the work, some group members’ strengths supplementing other members’ weaknesses.
<u>What could be improved</u>: Admittedly, a lot of the work was done pretty close to the end date.
<u>At least one thing that was surprising</u>: How exciting a day in the life of an IT professional can be! (Not very)
<u>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</u>: I used to not like group work very much back in high school, but Uni’s a much better environment for such things. You meet cool people, and work with other students who can do things you’re not that great at!

<p><u>What went well</u>: Everyone in the group delivered their work on time, ensuring they tried their best in terms of quality and effort. Many of us were on the right page and we divided the work equally among us. Communication was clear and concise- when a group member didn’t understand something, they would message the group chat or speak to us personally. Overall everyone did the work they were assigned to, the group was very transparent and I can say with confidence everyone did well.  
<u>What could be improved</u>: We had many errors with Github on invitations (to the group assignment), uploading pictures and most of the work was done towards the deadline so perhaps better organisation would assist in executing better work. 
<u>At least one thing that was surprising</u>: Learning about other sections not just my own (machine learning) such as Cryptocurrency, Cloud and Cybersecurity.
<u>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</u>: Groups require everyone to communicate and cooperate, therefore, it is important that everyone knows what to do. In addition, working with groups has led me to believe that it is important that everyone took charge and played the leadership role.

<p><u>What went well</u>: I think everyone in our group is very cooperative, and the project is going very smoothly. We can identify problems and solve problems together. I think this is a very good thing.
<u>What could be improved</u>:  In fact, we have encountered more difficulties in the part of the webpage, but in the end we can solve the corresponding problem well.
<u>At least one thing that I have learned about groups</u>: I found it very interesting to be in the group activities at the university, and I have seen a lot of ways to deal with problems and how to communicate. In fact, a well-connected team will make everyone make up for each other's shortcomings.

                              <p><u>What went well:</u>
In our group it seemed that we were all able to write up our fair share of work and it was easy to split up the work together, all the text seemed to be completed on time.</p>
                             <p><u>What could be improved:</u>
When It came to building the website it was left to the final day, if we had started working on the actual website earlier we would have been more relaxed with completing the assignment. With the website building not everyone got involved so it felt like some people were carrying their weight more than others.</p>
                              <p><u>What was surprising:</u>
                              It was surprising to see how quickly we were able to get all the content done.</p>
                              <p><u>What have I learnt about groups:</u>
I have learnt that groups need management and direction and can sometimes be difficult assigning what tasks to certain people and agreeing on certain directions.
