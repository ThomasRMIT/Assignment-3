I'm a huge fan of Tabletop Roleplaying Games. I've always been interested in IT. It's such a huge part of our lives, and many people, businesses and even governments depend on it. And it's growing. It's an ever expanding field; and it will become more and more impressive as technology keeps developing. I'm personally interested in delving into the world of cybersecurity, protecting various clients from intrusion. As for experience, I’ve got exactly none. </p>

                              <h3><b>Topic</b></h3>
                        <p>We want to create a simple-to-operate program for users that can increase security on their systems to defend a system from intrusion, stop personal data being leaked through websites, emails, mobile data storage and much more! STEVE, being a simple-to-operate program, is also a tool for learning, STEVE will be equipped with a library of known scams and tactics, as well as the ability to recognise them. STEVE is able to alert the user to what the detected intrusion attempt is doing, and provide instructions on how to stop it or have an option to enable STEVE to defend against such intrusions automatically, whilst providing feedback and the process taken.<br>
We want STEVE to educate users against the tactics that hostile parties would use against them. STEVE would protect the user, but ultimately; any security system is only as strong as its weakest link. Sometimes, the problem exists between the keyboard and the chair. But with STEVE, hopefully society will become more wary of scammers and phishers.</p>
                              
                              <h3><b>Motivation</b></h3>
<p>A world free of corruption, of deceit, and of fear is a beautiful vision. Stop Technologically Educated Villains Embezzling (STEVE) could help achieve that. Some might say it’s a bit ambitious, but it’s within reach. Security may not be that ‘sexy’, when it comes to IT trends; but it’s a necessity. Protecting the user from scams, virus and phishing is important work; and if we’re able to do it, it’ll show future employers that we can stick with an essential, long-term project. It’ll also show off our skills as a team, and individuals.</p>
                              
                              <h3><b>Landscape</b></h3>
                              <p>Many competitors exist for *one* facet of STEVE. The anti-virus aspect of it is something that’s been done many times, and done pretty well. Sure, systems are still infected; but every system is only as strong as its weakest point. That’s where our difference comes into play. STEVE is a tool for *educating* the user; so they’re less likely to click on suspicious links or download untrustworthy attachments. It might teach them to improve their passwords, and be more conscious about to whom they’re giving their information. It might even teach them better security practices, locking their computer/device if they have to leave it unattended for a short while.</p>

									<h2>Project Ideas</h2> <span class="image featured"><img src="images/lock.jpg" width="330" height="185" alt="" /></span>
<b></b>
							<p>The security of systems and users have always been a concern of the manufacturing company. With the implementation of firewall by countless organisations and many programs designed to defend the system from malware and system optimisation for increased performance, security has become easier to manage. The means by obtaining such programs can either be for free or obtained by purchasing a subscription for a certain amount of time. However, utilising software that isn't already preinstalled on the computer and/or purchasing a subscription can be avoided if the user were to have the knowledge about the internet and how to utilise it without getting viruses or any of the nasty malicious software on the computer in the first place. </p>
<p>S.T.E.V.E (or STEVE), is a simple-to-operate program for users that can increase security on their systems to defend a system from intrusion, stop personal data being leaked through websites, emails, mobile data storage and so much more. STEVE, being a simple-to-operate program, is also a program for learning, STEVE will be equipped with a library of known scams and tactics, as well as the ability to recognise them. STEVE is able to alert the user to what the detected intrusion attempt is doing, and provide instructions on how to stop it or have an option to enable STEVE to defend against such intrusions automatically, whilst providing feedback and the process taken. It will also have the ability to scan any page, forum or application that requires the user give their personal data to. If STEVE detects certain issues with the page in question, such as bad grammar or references to international banks such as Western Union; it will warn the user. </p>
<p>From an industry standpoint, not all industries want to hire people to stay on-guard just to protect their information, especially when the database isn't very big and easier to manage, for bigger organisations, that may change. STEVE will be able to utilise machine learning to assist the growing or the big industries in their security. Provided that STEVE is not capable to provide all the aid that is required, STEVE will act as a barrier for the malicious attack from external ane/or internal sources. If STEVE is unable to act against the malicious attack, professionals would be required to resolve the attack. With so many websites taking data from their users, and corporations and governments spying on the people for their own sinister purposes, having an extra layer of protection is beneficial for corporate and personal use, to train and to protect.</p>
<p>Detecting the threats such as phishing, malicious software can prove itself to be difficult to most, if not, some users. Having STEVE will make detecting phishing and other known dangers seem trivial through its library of common tactics and schemes that scammers, companies and governments use to obtain personal information and what they do with it. Educating users whether or not they should trust something with their data is the goal for the creation of STEVE as a lot of people are unable to recognise such threats and fall into their trap and have their way with your personal information, whether that is to distribute it or to mess the user's system up. STEVE can only do what the user tells STEVE to do and is also limited to its capabilities. At the end of the day, it's up to the users to decide as to what to do when receiving warning messages, whether to trust and allow the software to pass through or not. This is not to say that STEVE will be an unbreakable shield for data as there will be ways to bypass everything, STEVE is there to educate and lend a helping hand when malicious software attacks.</p>
<p>STEVE is for industrial and personal usage, to educate and ultimately allow the users to become more conscious with their personal information and how they protect it if they do, both online and offline. Utilising STEVE to secure information for big and small will assist the general public enjoy a life with a lessened risk of having their data stolen.</p>

									<h2>Group Reflection</h2> <span class="image featured"><img src="images/globetechcs.jpg" alt="" /></span>

				<p> Caner Peler <br/> As a group the communication was well done, as we kept our communication consistent out side of class with a group chat we made. There was high levels of idea sharing and individual tasks taken, which was completed early due to our commitment to our group work. All members completed their relevant specified roles.  A possible improvement we as a group could have done is having a plan, to make the selecting process easier instead of picking our roles as we went. As I group I’ve learned a lot about each individuals desires and passion about technology. Also as a group I think we get along pretty well. For contribution, id say it was fairy distributed and fairly done.
   </p>
<p>Thomas Jukes </p>
<p><u>What went well</u>: I think we all pulled together and did a good job actually completing the work, some group members’ strengths supplementing other members’ weaknesses.
<u>What could be improved</u>: Admittedly, a lot of the work was done pretty close to the end date.
<u>At least one thing that was surprising</u>: How exciting a day in the life of an IT professional can be! (Not very)
<u>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</u>: I used to not like group work very much back in high school, but Uni’s a much better environment for such things. You meet cool people, and work with other students who can do things you’re not that great at!
 </p>
<p>Simon Tang </p>
<p><u>What went well</u>: Everyone in the group delivered their work on time, ensuring they tried their best in terms of quality and effort. Many of us were on the right page and we divided the work equally among us. Communication was clear and concise- when a group member didn’t understand something, they would message the group chat or speak to us personally. Overall everyone did the work they were assigned to, the group was very transparent and I can say with confidence everyone did well.  
<u>What could be improved</u>: We had many errors with Github on invitations (to the group assignment), uploading pictures and most of the work was done towards the deadline so perhaps better organisation would assist in executing better work. 
<u>At least one thing that was surprising</u>: Learning about other sections not just my own (machine learning) such as Cryptocurrency, Cloud and Cybersecurity.
<u>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</u>: Groups require everyone to communicate and cooperate, therefore, it is important that everyone knows what to do. In addition, working with groups has led me to believe that it is important that everyone took charge and played the leadership role.
 </p>
<p> Calvin Fung</p>
<p><u>What went well</u>: I think everyone in our group is very cooperative, and the project is going very smoothly. We can identify problems and solve problems together. I think this is a very good thing.
<u>What could be improved</u>:  In fact, we have encountered more difficulties in the part of the webpage, but in the end we can solve the corresponding problem well.
<u>At least one thing that I have learned about groups</u>: I found it very interesting to be in the group activities at the university, and I have seen a lot of ways to deal with problems and how to communicate. In fact, a well-connected team will make everyone make up for each other's shortcomings.

                              <p><b>Rafi Pincus</b></p>
                              <p><u>What went well:</u>
In our group it seemed that we were all able to write up our fair share of work and it was easy to split up the work together, all the text seemed to be completed on time.</p>
                             <p><u>What could be improved:</u>
When It came to building the website it was left to the final day, if we had started working on the actual website earlier we would have been more relaxed with completing the assignment. With the website building not everyone got involved so it felt like some people were carrying their weight more than others.</p>
                              <p><u>What was surprising:</u>
                              It was surprising to see how quickly we were able to get all the content done.</p>
                              <p><u>What have I learnt about groups:</u>
I have learnt that groups need management and direction and can sometimes be difficult assigning what tasks to certain people and agreeing on certain directions.
                              </p>
