                              <h3><b>Topic</b></h3>
                        <p>We want to create a simple-to-operate program for users that can increase security on their systems to defend a system from intrusion, stop personal data being leaked through websites, emails, mobile data storage and much more! STEVE, being a simple-to-operate program, is also a tool for learning, STEVE will be equipped with a library of known scams and tactics, as well as the ability to recognise them. STEVE is able to alert the user to what the detected intrusion attempt is doing, and provide instructions on how to stop it or have an option to enable STEVE to defend against such intrusions automatically, whilst providing feedback and the process taken.<br>
We want STEVE to educate users against the tactics that hostile parties would use against them. STEVE would protect the user, but ultimately; any security system is only as strong as its weakest link. Sometimes, the problem exists between the keyboard and the chair. But with STEVE, hopefully society will become more wary of scammers and phishers.</p>
                              
                              <h3><b>Motivation</b></h3>
<p>A world free of corruption, of deceit, and of fear is a beautiful vision. Stop Technologically Educated Villains Embezzling (STEVE) could help achieve that. Some might say it’s a bit ambitious, but it’s within reach. Security may not be that ‘sexy’, when it comes to IT trends; but it’s a necessity. Protecting the user from scams, virus and phishing is important work; and if we’re able to do it, it’ll show future employers that we can stick with an essential, long-term project. It’ll also show off our skills as a team, and individuals.</p>
                              
                              <h3><b>Landscape</b></h3>
                              <p>Many competitors exist for *one* facet of STEVE. The anti-virus aspect of it is something that’s been done many times, and done pretty well. Sure, systems are still infected; but every system is only as strong as its weakest point. That’s where our difference comes into play. STEVE is a tool for *educating* the user; so they’re less likely to click on suspicious links or download untrustworthy attachments. It might teach them to improve their passwords, and be more conscious about to whom they’re giving their information. It might even teach them better security practices, locking their computer/device if they have to leave it unattended for a short while.</p>

</header>
                              <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
                              <p>Upon receiving $1,000,000 funding for our project our small little group decided it was time to expand. As we needed extremely qualified professionals we have decided that we will be looking to fill four crucial roles. These roles are: Project Manager, Software Engineer, Penetration tester and UI designer.</p>
                              
                                       <h3><b>Project Manager</b></h3>
                              <p>The project manager for STEVE will oversee all aspects of this software project. We will need someone who can set deadlines, assign responsibilities and monitor and summarize progress of project. The project manager will need to have great leadership and communication skills in order to ensure that the team is working as efficiently  as possible. The project manager will also report back to the executives in our business (which will be us) and give us a report on how the development is going and if changes need to be made. Our project manager will need to have an understanding of multiple coding languages and will need to have experience managing previous projects in the past. This role is probably the most crucial role as it requires a lot more than a skill set but rather a very strong leader that can delegate tasks as necessary with effective communication.</p>
							
               <h3><b>Software Engineer</b></h3>
                              <p>A software engineer will be the backbone to our software’s development. They will do all the hard nitty gritty word of actually coding the software and making sure that it is working as it should. The  Software engineers that we are looking for need to have Java basic technology, WEB front-end technology, database technology, big data technology, and .NET technology. We will need around 2-3 software engineers for this development as there is a large amount of code that needs to be written and perfected.</p>
                              
							 <h3><b>Penetration tester</b></h3>
                              <p>The penetration tester will have indeed a very important role. We will need a highly skilled security specialist that will spend many hours attempting to breach our computer and network security system. As we are a security company it is of the most utmost importance that our product will be able to deliver an extremely high-end security solution without any flaws. The penetration tester will work from different locations and networks, and on different devices in order to understand how impenetrable or penetrable our system is.</p>
                              
                               <h3><b>UI Designer</b></h3>
                              <p>The UI designer will have a role of creating amazing user experiences. Ideally, they should have an eye for clean and artful design. We will need someone experienced in the design and computing field, as they will be designing the direct to market interface. UI is very important in our application as no matter how powerful the security is, it is a vital part of the application that our security system will also teach the user of known risk and how to prevent them. If this learning process does not have a clean crisp interface the user will not be interested in learning thus having a qualified experienced UI designer is vital.</p>

                              <h3><b>Caner Peler</b></h3> <p><b>What went well</b><br>
                              I believe as a group we performed on a high level as we communicated extremely well and consistently, leading us to quickly and easily share the work evenly and fairly. All individuals in the group had invested many effort and time into this project as all members were working on this work consistently to allow us to finish this project in a reasonable time due to our great work effort and individual handling our responsibilities well.<br>
                              <b>What could be improved</b><br>
                              The only flaws as a group we have experienced within and the upcoming of this project is, the late preparation to our presentation. We have only had a few days to prep for it, although this isn’t a major concern as we still have some time to focus and prep for it i believe it could have been beneficial to have had early pre-rehearsals to have minimised possible errors and conquered mistakes to have a highly fluent and coherent presentation. <br>
                              <b>At least one thing that was surprising</b><br>
                              I found the amount of work and individuals required to create an app or a software that sounds simple when verbally explained, is compellingly even more difficult when you go into planning. As you realise the key components required, involve many work, time and effort. Which equates to a lot of capital being required to completed such a project like this.<br>
                              <b>At least one thing you have learned about groups</b><br>
                              At least one thing that you have learned about groups:
What i have taken away with me after the completion of this group project, is that it is heavily dependent on communication. You have to be constantly be informing each member on what work is being done or what needs to be done because there is only one project but many of us, therefore we need to inform each other of what is being completed. </p>



                              <h3><b>Thomas Jukes</b> </h3>
<p><b>What went well</b><br>  I think we did a great job at dividing the responsibilities between all group members; each of us tackling the assignment piecemeal and finishing it within a reasonable time. I felt very comfortable dealing with my own sections knowing that others would be working on theirs at the same time.<br>
<b>What could be improved</b><br>Perhaps more effort could have gone into creating artefacts and little snippets of what STEVE would be supposed to do, like a database of known scams *actually* being made. In addition; maybe more preparation could have been done regarding the presentation… but I’m confident that will work out fine.<br>
<b>At least one thing that was surprising</b><br>Creating a timeframe and reasonable expectations is *hard*. You need to plan ahead, take into account what is *reasonable*; and don’t get me started on *budgeting*! <br>

  <b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b><br>Misery shared is misery divided. On a less flippant note, part of uni life is that everyone has their own schedules and timetables; things that need to be worked around and taken into account, such as other assignments.
 </p>
                              
                              <h3><b>Simon Tang</b></h3>
<p><b>What went well</b><br>Everyone within the group took responsibility of their own work and understood that this was a group assignment, thus showed more concern towards their own work and their fellow group members.<br>  
  <b>What could be improved</b><br>Quality of work, all of us had a lot of assignments due, which heavily affected our work quality and effort. However, overall I believe everyone did well and tried their best to produce the final outcome.<br>
<b>At least one thing that was surprising</b><br> Developing a cybersecurity software requires serious funding, knowledge and dedication and companies that have succeeded have taken risks, applied their knowledge and have done substantial research.<br>
<b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b><br> Groups can sometimes be unorganized, not everyone is on the same timetable and like most have other assignments due on certain dates, therefore, it is important to communicate to other members what can be done and what can be left to finish another time.
 </p>
                              <h3><b>Calvin Fung</b></h3>
<p><b>What went well</b><br>The work of our team has progressed very smoothly, and we have tried our best to do our best. We work very hard in this project, and we have a division of work for each job so that everyone can play what they are good at. Of course, a good project must have good communication. Everyone in the group will have some problems, but the team members in the group will help solve the problem in time. This is the best place I think. Overall, the team did a very good job and everyone did a very good job.<br>
<b>What could be improved</b><br>I think what we need to improve is the management of time. Undoubtedly, as a month near the end of the period, everyone will have a lot of work, so this will affect the communication between us. The different working hours of everyone will lead to delays in our projects, but I believe that every group in the group everyone has fulfilled their responsibilities and completed the work, and the results of the final effort are also very satisfactory to everyone.<br>
  <b>At least one thing that was surprising</b><br>It turns out that in the process of developing software, it takes a lot of time and human resources to deal with the problems of various technologies. Regardless of the question of money, the technical requirements for developing software for team members are too great, and the development of a good software must take into account and consider all aspects of the problem, and must have a rigorous spirit and attitude to make good Effect. Knowledge is very important.<br>
<b>At least one thing that I have learned about groups</b><br>Every member of the group has different subjects from themselves, so most of the time everyone is doing different things. Of course, everyone is very much looking forward to the group meeting, because everyone can meet in this class and Talking about the things we do, but it's no surprise that everyone should do their own thing.
</p>
                              <h3><b>Rafi Pincus</b></h3>
                              <p><b>What went well</b><br>
I was very impressed with this group for the final assignment. After our previous assignment it was very evident that we did not manage our time effectively last assignment, where most of the work was done the weekend it was due. However, when it came to this assignment, we could see that there a large amount of work that needed to be completed, therefore we decided to allocate tasks week by week. This worked very well as by the day of submission came around, we were very prepared and had all of our content ready to go well ahead of time.<br>
                             <b>What could be improved</b><br>
What could be improved was our teams communication, whilst everyone did the work that was required, the work was not done in cohesion meaning that not everyone knew what other people have written which could bring forth confusion when it comes to the presentation.<br>
                              <b>At least one thing that was surprising</b><br>
                              What was surprising with our group was how easily we were able to become cohesive, from the beginning of our group forming we did not have many disagreements and we never sat in silence. It was great to see that we were all able to help each other whether it be help with iPhone games, help with other subjects or help with our course direction and career path. It was a very friendly group and was a joy to work with them.<br>
                              <b>What have I learnt about groups</b><br>
One thing I have learnt about groups is that everyone has their role to play and everyone must understand their role. Once everyone understands their role the group is able to progress and with teamwork the huge amount of work to be done can be brought down to a very manageable individual level. With groups it is important to have a leader  so there can be a clear directional path and will prevent a shambolic collaborative mess.
                              </p>
                              
                               <h3><b>Alexander Chen</b></h3>
                              <p><b>What went well</b><br>
For the final assignment for intro to IT, the members of S.T.E.V.E were not only able to do their fair share of the work, but go beyond the expectation that I had envisioned. They helped each other out and designated the work evenly so that no member is doing too much or too little and were able to communicate effectively throughout the duration of the assignment.
<br>
                             <b>What could be improved</b><br>
Like a lot of group work, some parts are left to the end. The presentation aspect of the assignment was left to the last part as well as the development of the website. The last month and a bit of the semester can get really busy with assignments after assignments as well as studying for the exam and it is understandable that everyone has to have their time off to relax and then get back to work. The assignment also required each member to draw information back to parts that the other members have written, having more communication for these aspects would have produced a better result.
<br>
                              <b>At least one thing that was surprising</b><br>
                             The members that formed S.T.E.V.E co-operated very well, since the formation of the group, each group member communicated with each other, got to understand each other more than some other groups would have.<br>
                              <b>At least one thing that I have learned about groups</b><br>
During the completion of the assignment, I have learnt that communication is fundamental. Without communication, completing the task at hand would be very difficult. If tasks were assigned during class and no communication were to be had outside of class, the information that each member has would not piece together well.
