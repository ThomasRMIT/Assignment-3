                              <h2>Aims</h2>
                              <p>S.T.E.V.E aims to educate its users about harmful malware and how to defend against such devious malware from affecting their computers performance to securing their personal details. Not only does S.T.E.V.E educate the users on how to fend off malware, but it also assists in detection and the removal of the ransomware. In order to achieve the goal of educating users on protecting themselves from ransomware, a database of existing scams and ransomware need to be created and acknowledged by S.T.E.V.E along with the solution to the issue. Experts in the cybersecurity and machine learning sector must also review and assist in implementing their expertise to make S.T.E.V.E run as intended, to educate and defend. As for the aesthetics of S.T.E.V.E, they don't need to be overly fancy, with the reviews and as time goes on during the testing and public release, the interface can always change and update along with the new patches of the program.<br>
If troubles occur during the making of S.T.E.V.E, the most important part of the project would be the plan B, to educate as opposed to educate and protect. If possible, S.T.E.V.E will still have the ability to detect ransomware and notify the user, if not, it'll be up to the user to use what they've learnt from S.T.E.V.E to defend against the issue that they have. Ransomware are being developed and require time to find a solution to cease the malware, therefore S.T.E.V.E will always be at least one step behind the developers of such programs. There is no solution to this issue, only to stay behind and catch up to prevent the malware from infecting more victims</p>
