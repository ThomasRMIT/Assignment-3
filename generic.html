                              <h2><b>Aims</b></h2>
                              <p>S.T.E.V.E aims to educate its users about harmful malware and how to defend against such devious malware from affecting their computers performance to securing their personal details. Not only does S.T.E.V.E educate the users on how to fend off malware, but it also assists in detection and the removal of the ransomware. In order to achieve the goal of educating users on protecting themselves from ransomware, a database of existing scams and ransomware need to be created and acknowledged by S.T.E.V.E along with the solution to the issue. Experts in the cybersecurity and machine learning sector must also review and assist in implementing their expertise to make S.T.E.V.E run as intended, to educate and defend. As for the aesthetics of S.T.E.V.E, they don't need to be overly fancy, with the reviews and as time goes on during the testing and public release, the interface can always change and update along with the new patches of the program.<br>
If troubles occur during the making of S.T.E.V.E, the most important part of the project would be the plan B, to educate as opposed to educate and protect. If possible, S.T.E.V.E will still have the ability to detect ransomware and notify the user, if not, it'll be up to the user to use what they've learnt from S.T.E.V.E to defend against the issue that they have. Ransomware are being developed and require time to find a solution to cease the malware, therefore S.T.E.V.E will always be at least one step behind the developers of such programs. There is no solution to this issue, only to stay behind and catch up to prevent the malware from infecting more victims</p>
                              
                              <h2><b>Plans and Progress</b></h2>
<p>As reiterated previously, S.T.E.V.E is a cybersecurity software designed to enhance information security and protect a computer, network or any computing-enabled device. It provides firewall protection(block network traffic), data protection, secures computers/systems against viruses, malware(damage or gain access to computer system), internet/network intrusions etc. But what it makes it different from our competitors is itâ€™s also used an educational tool. To put it simply, this is the ultimate security software, that this group has envisioned. Unfortunately, due to the substantial amount of planning that needs to be done such as the user interface (how it will be presented), the level of expertise and coding to design such an application and the amount of money to design a security software in a global scale presents challenging obstacles. However, that is not to say that it is impossible- we plan to approach this in little steps combined with efficient planning; making sure errors and hardship can be dealt with immediately and effectively to limit costs and time. The project began with an idea that we felt would positively impact society, thus the creation of S.T.E.V.E. Once this was completed- ideas, limits, technology, developers and many planning had begun to initiate the project, we soon came to the realization that planning and executing S.T.E.V.E would be difficult and time consuming. Therefore, we cut out the educational section of the project along with some features in order to reduce the time restraint and money and as we generate more revenue we can invest more resources into the project to complete S.T.E.V.E. If this software does become successful and income starts to generate then it will be used to strengthen the software by providing additional and new features, more research on cybersecurity and innovation tactics to prevent viruses and malware. We are projected to complete the basics of a security software within a couple of months through combined knowledge of expertise in specific fields and our own research, which includes an antivirus feature, auto-cleaning and real-time scanning. As of now, no features have been directly implemented within the software but plans and tests have been done to replicate the final product, this is because we believe the plan to be a blueprint and should strictly be followed especially if we were to hand over to another team to complete. Of course, it will continue to alter and change if we deem necessary. We hope that S.T.E.V.E will continue to progress at a reasonable rate and one day see the final outcome we have envisioned. </p>
