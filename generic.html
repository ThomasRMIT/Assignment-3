                              <h2><b>Aims</b></h2>
                              <p>S.T.E.V.E aims to educate its users about harmful malware and how to defend against such devious malware from affecting their computers performance to securing their personal details. Not only does S.T.E.V.E educate the users on how to fend off malware, but it also assists in detection and the removal of the ransomware. In order to achieve the goal of educating users on protecting themselves from ransomware, a database of existing scams and ransomware need to be created and acknowledged by S.T.E.V.E along with the solution to the issue. Experts in the cybersecurity and machine learning sector must also review and assist in implementing their expertise to make S.T.E.V.E run as intended, to educate and defend. As for the aesthetics of S.T.E.V.E, they don't need to be overly fancy, with the reviews and as time goes on during the testing and public release, the interface can always change and update along with the new patches of the program.<br>
If troubles occur during the making of S.T.E.V.E, the most important part of the project would be the plan B, to educate as opposed to educate and protect. If possible, S.T.E.V.E will still have the ability to detect ransomware and notify the user, if not, it'll be up to the user to use what they've learnt from S.T.E.V.E to defend against the issue that they have. Ransomware are being developed and require time to find a solution to cease the malware, therefore S.T.E.V.E will always be at least one step behind the developers of such programs. There is no solution to this issue, only to stay behind and catch up to prevent the malware from infecting more victims</p>
                              
                              <h2><b>Plans and Progress</b></h2>
<p>As reiterated previously, S.T.E.V.E is a cybersecurity software designed to enhance information security and protect a computer, network or any computing-enabled device. It provides firewall protection(block network traffic), data protection, secures computers/systems against viruses, malware(damage or gain access to computer system), internet/network intrusions etc. But what it makes it different from our competitors is it’s also used an educational tool. To put it simply, this is the ultimate security software, that this group has envisioned. Unfortunately, due to the substantial amount of planning that needs to be done such as the user interface (how it will be presented), the level of expertise and coding to design such an application and the amount of money to design a security software in a global scale presents challenging obstacles. However, that is not to say that it is impossible- we plan to approach this in little steps combined with efficient planning; making sure errors and hardship can be dealt with immediately and effectively to limit costs and time. The project began with an idea that we felt would positively impact society, thus the creation of S.T.E.V.E. Once this was completed- ideas, limits, technology, developers and many planning had begun to initiate the project, we soon came to the realization that planning and executing S.T.E.V.E would be difficult and time consuming. Therefore, we cut out the educational section of the project along with some features in order to reduce the time restraint and money and as we generate more revenue we can invest more resources into the project to complete S.T.E.V.E. If this software does become successful and income starts to generate then it will be used to strengthen the software by providing additional and new features, more research on cybersecurity and innovation tactics to prevent viruses and malware. We are projected to complete the basics of a security software within a couple of months through combined knowledge of expertise in specific fields and our own research, which includes an antivirus feature, auto-cleaning and real-time scanning. As of now, no features have been directly implemented within the software but plans and tests have been done to replicate the final product, this is because we believe the plan to be a blueprint and should strictly be followed especially if we were to hand over to another team to complete. Of course, it will continue to alter and change if we deem necessary. We hope that S.T.E.V.E will continue to progress at a reasonable rate and one day see the final outcome we have envisioned. </p>

                              
                              <h2><b>Scope and Limits</b></h2>
                              <p>With little experience and time as a team, there will not be enough capacity to complete a fully functioning program to match our vision. This will ultimately mean that the application won’t be capable of educating our potential and future users of all malicious viruses. As we have intended to educate our users of all virus possible, when the application has successfully been executed and prevented the infection of the virus. It would then educate the user of the causes and outcomes if this virus had successfully intercepted into the device. Then further explaining how to prevent this mistake from happening again. However due to the level cap of skills decreasing the time available to us, will not allow us to have all features available. Meaning we can create an application which prevents all types of viruses but not being able to implement the idea of educating our users about all viruses. And in later stages this can be updated with patches and updates, to make it fully functioning to our desired vision. The scope this project will create and present a fully functioning anti-virus application, however unsure to the degree and advancement this will hold. Meaning how efficient and well this application will compare to competitors such as Norton and avast, whom might have a program much more advanced compared to what we will be able to produce in with our limited skill and time available. Continuing, this will then lead to our limitation of then preventing us possible of not being able to implement the main and purpose for this application, the educating phase.</p>
                              
                              <h2><b>Tools and Technologies</b></h2>
                              <p>As our technology is largely software based we will need to acquire a software license for our program S.T.E.V.E,the point of the software license is to ensure that our program can meet certain guidelines as well as be reputable in the eyes of the public. The license also ensures that people will not copy our program and we can place a copyright on the program as well. We will need something like a public domain license to enable us to sell off our program. To develop our program a simple laptop or computer will not suffice, we will need multiple high end machines to ensure that the team we establish will able to do vigorous tests on our applications and run some tricky programming to make sure that there is a very high amount of security prevention installed within the application. We will also need to establish a server for the application, as the application is security plus education there will be an automated learning facility built in to the app. This learning facility will teach the program what are common ways of security threats and cybercrime. This data will need to be stored on a database as well as a server so we can relay the information back to the user via the internet. Our group has limited amount of prior experience with security and app development; however it is great that we are learning programming so we can use our knowledge we are gaining to help create this app.</p>
                              <h2><b>Testing</b></h2>
                             <p> Our product will be test via running several test of pre-maid virus containing content to see if it can actually recognise and defeat it. If this is achieved the next step will be delivering to the user what the virus was and what caused it and how can the user prevent this from happening again. However this will be displayed in a beginner user friendly way as this is also a learning experience for average users on the internet who are unfamiliar with the infectious viruses. The user testing method that will be undertaken is finding any user who is an internet user or explorer who is unfamiliar with viruses or who wants to learn more. And then allow them to conduct searches and exploration on a pre made environment which has viruses implemented in it for the user to have a for filling experience and testing for the ultimate feedback. This test will ultimately be run by over 100 individuals with different skills and sets to have this as a diverse application for all users.</p>
